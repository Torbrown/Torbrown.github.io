    <p>The pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay">jay</a> between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jay">North American blue jay</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_jay">Eurasian jay</a> in size. The voice is described as a rhythmic krawk-kraw-krawk repeated two or three times. It is the only member of the genus Gymnorhinus. Its overall proportions are very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%27s_nutcracker">nutcracker-like</a> and indeed this can be seen as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">convergent evolution</a> as both birds fill similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche">ecological niches</a>. The pinyon jay is a bluish-grey coloured bird with deeper head colouring and whitish throat with black bill, legs and feet.</p>

    <h2 id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>

    <p>The pinyon jay was described by German explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Maximilian_of_Wied-Neuwied">Prince Maximilian</a> of Wied-Neuwied in 1841, from a specimen shot along the Maria River in Northern Montana during his expedition to the Interior of North America in 1833.
    It is the sole member of the genus Gymnorhinus. No subspecies are recognised.
      Genetic analysis suggests that the pinyon jay is an offshoot from a lineage that gave rise to the scrub-jays and relatives (Aphelocoma) and Cyanocitta (blue jay and Steller's jay).
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> has designated "pinyon jay" the official common name for the species. It was historically known as the blue crow or Maximilian's jay</p>
    <h2 id="DistributionandHabitat">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
    <p>Pinyon jays are residents from central Oregon to western South Dakota, south to northern Baja California, northwestern and east-central Arizona, central New Mexico, and western Oklahoma. They winter throughout their breeding range and irregularly from southern Washington to northwestern Montana, and south to Mexico and central Texas. When pinyon seed crops are poor, pinyon jays may wander to central Washington, northwestern Oregon, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, throughout the Great Basin, Nebraska, Kansas, central-western and southwestern California, southeastern Arizona, central Texas, and northern Chihuahua. The pinyon jay is casual in Iowa and a sight report exists in Saskatchewan.
    The pinyon jay is a permanent resident of pinyon-juniper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyon%E2%80%93juniper_woodland">(Pinus-Juniperus spp.)</a> woodlands and low-elevation ponderosa pine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyon%E2%80%93juniper_woodland">(Pinus ponderosa)</a> forests in the southwestern United States. Pinyon-juniper woodlands are composed primarily of Colorado pinyon (P. edulis) and Utah juniper (J. osteosperma) and cover vast acreages in Colorado, northern Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Other pinyon and juniper species occurring in these woodlands include singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla), Parry pinyon (P. quadrifolia), Mexican pinyon (P. cembroides), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum), and California juniper (J. californica). The pinyon jay relies on singleleaf pinyon in the northwestern portion of its range and Colorado pinyon in the southeastern portion of its range. Ponderosa pines of the southwestern United States include interior ponderosa pine (P. p. var. scopulorum) and Arizona pine (P. p. var. arizonica). In this article, "pinyon" refers to both Colorado pinyon and singleleaf pinyon, and "ponderosa pine" refers to interior ponderosa pine and Arizona pine unless otherwise specified.
    Pinyon jays prefer pinyon-juniper woodlands, and ponderosa pine forests. They interact in a mutual relationship with the pinyon. Pinyon trees provide pinyon jays with food, nesting and roosting sites, and breeding stimuli. Pinyon jays influence seed dispersal, establishment, and genetic structure of pinyon populations.
    Pinyon jays use Colorado pinyon in the southeastern portion of their range and singleleaf pinyon in the northwestern portion of their range. The Colorado pinyon begins to bear cones at 25 years of age and produces "substantial" nut crops at an interval of 4 to 7 years, and sometimes every 3 to 5 years. Good cone crops tend to be localized and occur at irregular and infrequent intervals but are geographically synchronous, perhaps to counteract seed predation. Bumper seed crops of the Colorado pinyon are episodic and are probably linked to favorable climatic conditions.
    Singleleaf pinyon may not produce cones until 35 years of age with a 2- to the 7-year interval between cone production years. The maximum seed production occurs when trees are 75 to 100 years old.</p>
    <h2 id="Behavior">Behavior</h2>
    <p>Pinyon jays are noisy groups, though they may form large of more than 250 to 500 members as they are watching out for predators while their companions are feeding seeds. They spend most of their time searching for seeds to be eaten on the spot, hide in the ground, or store in a tree crevice to eat later. They utilize pinyon, western juniper and ponderosa pine trees for cover. Roosting sites rarely occur in the last area that was used for foraging that day. Before roosting, a flock of pinyon jays in northern Arizona flew 1 to 3 miles (1.6–4.8 km) from the feeding site. Roosting birds clumped together in groups of 3 to 5 individuals.</p>

    <h2 id="Status">Status</h2>
    <p>The Pinyon jay is listed as a species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species">Vulnerable</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. Between 1859 and 1880, it is estimated to 400,000 and 525,000 of pinyon woodlands was mostly used for mine construction and production of the charcoal. Between 1950 and 1964, an estimated 3 million acres of pinyon woodlands were used, this led to millions of Pinyon jays that may have died. Pinyon Jay is probably based mainly on climate impacts on pinyon-juniper habitats and management practices that may impact habitat quality, These impacts and predictions have increased concern over the future of the vulnerability of Pinyon Jay. Across the West, thinning, fire and chemical treatment of pinyon-juniper woodlands have increasingly been used to reduce potential wildfire risk on them or to improve biodiversity or ecological condition, this led to Pinyon Jays stopped nesting within the thinned areas of a traditional nesting colony. A human development such as oil and gas wells may affect Pinyon Jays as they tend to avoid nesting near the developments, and also an unknown decline of insect populations worldwide.</p>
