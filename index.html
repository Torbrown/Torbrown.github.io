    <p>The pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) is a jay between the North American blue jay and the Eurasian jay in size. The voice is described as a rhythmic krawk-kraw-krawk repeated two or three times. It is the only member of the genus Gymnorhinus. Its overall proportions are very nutcracker-like and indeed this can be seen as convergent evolution as both birds fill similar ecological niches. The pinyon jay is a bluish-grey coloured bird with deeper head colouring and whitish throat with black bill, legs and feet.</p>

    <p>The pinyon jay was described by German explorer Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied in 1841, from a specimen shot along the Maria River in Northern Montana during his expedition to the Interior of North America in 1833.
    It is the sole member of the genus Gymnorhinus. No subspecies are recognised.</p>
    <p> Genetic analysis suggests that the pinyon jay is an offshoot from a lineage that gave rise to the scrub-jays and relatives (Aphelocoma) and Cyanocitta (blue jay and Steller's jay).
    The International Ornithologists' Union has designated "pinyon jay" the official common name for the species. It was historically known as the blue crow or Maximilian's jay</p>
